        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>If you want to build a website and don't want to dig around in code, and all that complicated HTML/CSS and
            Javascript (Opposite of me, I love to code). If you just need a website fast and get it up and running as
            quickly as possible, this post is for you because here, I'm reviewing the best website builders that I had
            to work with (This website wasn't made with a website builder). You may have heard some names like Google
            Sites, Wix, Weebly, WordPress.org, and Webflow, but you have no idea what these are.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="What-is">
        <h2>What is a Website Builder?</h2>
        <p>A website builder is a program that allows you to make a website with no code it usually runs on on your
            Browser(WordPress runs on your computer), has a drag and drop editor, allows you to write content, create
            forms and much much more</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Webflow">
        <img src="Images/Webflow-inteface.png" alt="Webflow interface design">
        <h2>Webflow</h2>
        <p>Webflow is intuitive and very focused on design which is the reason that many like it. It also has every tool
            necessary to start a blog using just the free version, which I think is quite lovely of Webflow, since this
            is not the case with WordPress.com, where you have to pay to do basically anything. Webflow also offers
            everything a
            builder should have and as I said earlier it is especially focused on animation and design. If you can
            animate something with code, you can animate it with Webflow.
        </p>
        <p>The learning curve is pretty steep, but you can watch their youtube tutorials on how to get started. Writing
            blog posts is also supported, but I would
            recommend something else because Webflow is much more powerful and complex. In Webflow, almost everything
            happens in their visual website editor which allows you to run and experience your site. It is drag and drop
            similar to Weebly, but is much more advanced than that since it allows for complex animations to take place.
        </p>
        <p>Pricing</p>
        <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>CMS: $23/month. Best for a content-driven website</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Business: $39/month. Best for a high-traffic website</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enterprise: Custom price. Best for a massive website</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are also some e-commerce plans that I won't mention here, but you can read all about them on their
            website
        </p>


    </div>
    <div id="Wordpress">
        <img src="Images/Wordpress-Interface.png" alt="WordPress interface design">
        <h2>WordPress</h2>
        <p>You've probably heard about WordPress since it is currently the most popular website builder on the web.
            There are actually two versions of WordPress, WordPress.com, and WordPress.org.
            The Difference is that WordPress.com can be obtained on the web and WordPress.org is the open-source
            downloadable version of WordPress which is free, though you do have to pay for hosting and a domain.
        </p>
        <p>WordPress is very powerful similar to Webflow and everything functions through the plugins that you can
            install. Plugins are extensions that customize the WordPress code allowing for new features. Plugins are
            WordPress's strength and weakness, they allow for customization, but also open the door for hackers making
            WordPress very insecure since anyone can make a plugin.
        </p>

        <p>WordPress also has excellent features if you're
            looking forward to starting a blog because that is what WordPress is best at since it has initially been
            created as a place to start a blog, but now it's capable of so much more. You can create everything be it a
            business website or an ecommerce store.</p>
        <p>Pricing</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Free open source</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Have to pay for Hosting and Domain</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="Wix">
        <img src="Images/Wix.png" alt="Wix interface design">
        <h2>Wix</h2>
        <p>Wix has become a new WordPress alternative that is more on the simple side. It has a very intuitive and
            easy-to-use interface, everything you need for starting an Ecommerce store or a simple blog, but sadly isn't
            so suitable for a big business website such as g2.com. Wix also has built-in monetization and SEO (Search
            Engine Optimization) which allows you to rank higher on Google.
        </p>
        <p>Out of all 5, the interface of Wix is the
            best since WordPress is a bit older and could change its interface completely and Webflow's interface is
            comparable but not as simple and easy-to-use as Wix. I would recommend using Wis if you want to start a blog
            and want a clean experience since it is very easy to manage your blog posts with Wix. It also offers
            customer support if that's something you're looking for.</p>
        <p>Pricing</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>All-in-one deals (Include domain and hosting, though you can get custom hosting)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Includes several Ecommerce plans which I won't cover here.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enterprise: Contact Wix
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>VIP: $46/month
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pro: $27/month (most popular)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Unlimited: $22/month
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Combo: $16
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Free Version(very limited)
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div id="Weebly">
        <img src="Images/Weebly-Interface.png" alt="Weebly interface design">
        <h2>Weebly</h2>
        <p>Weebly is a perfect no-code website builder for beginners, it offers a generous free plan if you're not
            planning to spend any money on your website, though it does come with a www.yoursite.weebly.com domain.
            Weebly is also easy to use just like Wix, though I found it difficult to drag everything in the right place,
            it could still be perfect for you.</p>
        <p>The interface isn't that well designed, but I'm being a perfectionist here because I'm a web designer myself
            so I would give the interface 8/10. I find it quite annoying that I can't return to the home page to look at
            the other pricing plans, but you probably don't need to do that.</p>
        <p>Pricing</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Free: $0/month
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Personal: $10/month
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Professional: $12/month
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Performance: $26/month
                </p>
            </li>

        </ul>

    </div>

    <div id="Google-Sites">
        <img src="Images/Bildschirmfoto 2024-01-07 um 11.22.55 AM.png" alt="Framer interface">
        <h2>Framer</h2>
        <p>Framer is an absolutely game changing tool when wanting to experiment with AI to make websites for you. It is absolutely crazy how well the AI incorporates your vision into the design you are making and also very cool to watch. Framer is also a generally good website builder even without AI features, but is kind of limited when compared to WordPress or Webflow for user control.</p>
        <p>Framer is a one stop solution to getting your site out on the internet fast and efficiently. On the pricing, it does have free plan, but I to my great discontent I can't exactly call it generous as you will have a domain.framer.com domain name and a Framer banner.</p>
        <p>Pricing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Free plan</p></li>
            <li><p>5$/month Mini plan for small websites</p></li>
            <li><p>15$/month Basic plan for mid sized websites</p></li>
            <li><p>30$/month Pro plan for large websites</p></li>
            <li><p>Custom Enterprise plan for very big business websites</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>These five website builders are the best that you can currently find on the market. You have a lot of
            options: Webflow for complex websites, Wix for a simple blog, and Google Sites for a one-pager. There are
            other website builders too which I didn't cover here so check them out too.
