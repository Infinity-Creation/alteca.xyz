        <h2 id="Bard">Google Bard</h2>
        <p>In addition to its summarization capabilities, Google Bard could also potentially function as an AI chatbot
            to answer questions about the summarized text. With enough training data and advances in natural language
            understanding, Google Bard's neural networks could learn to comprehend users' questions and respond with
            relevant and fact-checked information extracted from the source text.</p>
        <p>Some of the functionalities Google Bard offers as an AI chatbot include:

        </p>
        <li>
            <p>Answering factual questions - By understanding the key entities, events and details mentioned in the
                source text, Google Bard could answer factual questions about who, what, when and where.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Providing definitions and explanations - Google Bard could define technical terms, and acronyms, and
                explain concepts based on the context and information in the source text.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Giving examples - For certain topics, Google Bard could provide concrete examples from the text to
                illustrate and clarify concepts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Highlighting key points - Users could ask Google Bard to highlight the most important takeaways and
                pivotal details in the summarized text.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Linking to related information - By leveraging its search capabilities, Google Bard could link to
                relevant web pages for users to learn more about related topics mentioned in the source text.</p>
        </li>
        <p>With enough training, Google Bard has the potential to become not just a summarization tool but also a
            capable AI chatbot assistant to help users better understand and gain insights from long-form texts, maybe
            even potentially beating GPT 4 though the latter is in a better position now.</p>
        <h2 id="ChatGPT">ChatGPT
        </h2>
        <p>A guide to AI tools would be a scam without mentioning ChatGPT which has been making waves in the AI industry
            for the past year. It is one of the most powerful AI Chatbots ever created and can process incredibly
            incomprehensible questions and give short and simple answers.</p>
        <p>ChatGPT is a conversational AI chatbot created by OpenAI that can carry on a coherent conversation and
            provide information based on natural language prompts. It uses a technique called GPT, which stands for
            Generative Pre-trained Transformer, that allows it to generate human-like responses at scale.</p>
        <p>ChatGPT was trained on a vast trove of online text which gives it a broad base of knowledge and the ability
            to converse about virtually any topic. When given a prompt in natural language, ChatGPT can provide
            insightful and nuanced responses that demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic at hand. It can answer
            questions, provide explanations and definitions, summarize information, generate stories and reports, and
            even write small programs based on natural language instructions.</p>
        <p>While ChatGPT's responses are often impressive in their detail and nuance, the technology still has
            limitations. The AI model can occasionally provide incorrect information or generate toxic, harmful or
            misleading content. It also struggles to reason about ethics or develop a "theory of mind" to truly
            understand humans. Additionally, ChatGPT's answers tend to be factually accurate but lack common sense in
            some cases.</p>
        <p>Despite these caveats, ChatGPT represents an important step forward for conversational AI. By demonstrating
            the potential of large language models to provide useful information based on natural language prompts,
            ChatGPT highlights both the promise and ethical challenges of more advanced AI systems in the future that
            aim to truly understand and converse with humans at scale.

        <h2 id="Dall-e">Dall-E</h2>
        <p>DALL·E is an AI system created by OpenAI that can generate original images from a text description. It uses a
            technique called diffusion models that allows it to generate highly realistic and creative images from text
            prompts in just a matter of seconds.</p>
        <p>DALL·E was trained on hundreds of millions of image-text pairs which allows it to understand how images and
            text relate to each other. When given a text prompt like "a teddy bear playing basketball", DALL·E can
            generate multiple novel images that match that description with impressive detail and accuracy. It considers
            factors like object poses, perspectives, textures, lighting, backgrounds and more to create images that
            align with the text prompt.

        </p>
        <p>The images generated by DALL·E often surprise humans with how creative and imaginative they can be. This is
            because DALL·E is not copying existing images but rather synthesizing completely new combinations of visual
            concepts based on its understanding of how images relate to text descriptions. However, DALL·E can also
            generate misleading, toxic or unsafe content which is why OpenAI has put various controls in place to
            mitigate risks.</p>
        <p>DALL·E represents a major milestone in AI, demonstrating that machines are getting better at not just
            recognizing visual concepts but also generating wholly original content that aligns with high-level
            descriptions. As diffusion models improve, AI image generators like DALL·E have the potential to inspire
            humans with new ideas and serve as a creative tool to help people visualize concepts that don't yet exist.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Playground">Playground AI</h2>
        <p>Playground AI is a great choice for if you are struggling to create good digital artwork on your own.
            Playground is one of the only free and reliable image generators out there. It can generate up to 4 images
            at a time and is based on the Stable Diffusion AI model.</p>
        <p>Images can be created in one of two modes, on the board or on the canvas, I recommend using the board first
            for small workloads, and unloading your creative spirit on the canvas which allows you to perform more
            advanced operations.Images can be upscaled 4 times if you like them allowing you to produce 4k images for
            free.</p>
        <p>Playground AI also has a vibrant and creative community which shares artwork with each other in the gallery.
            Due to the Stable Diffusion AI model, the images that are produced are extremely accurate most of the
            time.Something to take into account when writing prompts is that when the model doesn't know what you're
            talking about then it will not deliver.</p>
        <h2 id="bing">Bing Chat</h2>
        <p>Bing Chat is Microsofts counterpart to ChatGPT and runs on the GPT 4 AI language model. Unlike ChatGPT, Bing
            Chat has a crucial feature that distinguishes it amongst other chatbots; Web Search. This feature is
            designed to help bloggers publish articles that are relevant to this specific point in time.</p>
        <p>It also gives sources when you use the "Web Search" feature which I find really helpful as bloggers can give
            credit to the cited sources. The AI decides itself whether to use the web search feature or not depending on
            the prompt</p>
        <p>Bing Chat completely demolishes ChatGPT 3.5 in every category since it uses a later and better language model
            than its competitor.</p>
        <p>Out of ChatGPT, Google Bard and Bing, Bing was the only AI able to correct me when I told all three AIs to
            write an article about chipmunks being stupid and destroying society. Bing refused to write the article and
            corrected me on the chipmunk's behalf.</p>
        <h2 id="copyai">Copy.ai</h2>
        <p>Copy.ai is yet another AI chatbot, but this time specifically focused on producing fresh content for
            copywriting and even sites the sources it used to compile the information.</p>
        <p>Copy.ai is a great choice for blogging and generally just writing, it helps you elaborate on the content that
            you have already produced with precise and helpful AI tools that you can use to level up your writing skills
            and complete large tasks far more quickly.</p>
        <h2 id="tabnine">Tabnine</h2>
        <p>Tabnine is a great choice if you're looking for an AI coding assistant as it autocompletes and tries to
            elaborate on all lines of code of your already existing program.

        </p>
        <p>Although the AI isn't as advanced and as smart as Github Copilot which is now leading in the space of AIs for
            coding, Tabnine is a reliable and usable AI that I use on a daily basis. The best thing about Tabnine is the
            fact that it is free to use, though you don't get the most advanced features it's free unlike Github Copilot
            which you have to pay for.

        </p>
        <p>The autocompletion features work seamlessly with the rest of your code, very accurately determining your
            intention with specific chunks of code and helping you plan out every detail. All round Tabnine is a great
            free alternative to Github Copilot</p>
        <h2 id="capcut">Capcut</h2>
        <p>Capcut is a truly special AI as it is an online AI video editor which many professional video editors use.
            Capcut is made by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance which also owns TikTok by the way.</p>
        <p>It is an excellent video editor with many AI features such AI voices and is even better than many paid and/or
            offline video editing software programs. Capcut is easy to use by having a very streamlined interface and no
            complex tracks or anything like that.

        </p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Now that you that you know many AIs that will help you along your journey in the complex realm of the
            internet you also have to consider the fact that these aren't the only AIs you can use as there are plenty
            of other great alternatives out there that are also worth a try. Dont forget to check on my <a
