        <h1>Inroduction to Scratch</h1>
        <h2>Learn how to code the simple way</h2>
        <div id="Intro">
            <p>In this course you will learn the basics of the programming language called
                scratch. Throughout this course you will be making multiple games such as: a maze game,
                a shooter game, and a flying game. In the course you will learn multiple programming tricks and you will get
                to know
                many famous scratchers and their works along the way.
            </p>

        <div id="interface">
            <h2>The Scratch interface</h2>
            <p>The scratch interface is pretty straitforward, there is a sprite pane which contains
                all the objects in your scene view, a code area where you can drag in blocks from the block palette
                and a sound and costume tabs. At the top of your project there is a "Save Now" button a few other options.
                to run your scripts click on the green flag at the top of the stage and on the stop sign to stop the project
                again.
                To create a new Sprite (Object) click on the cat face with a plus and select one from the scratch sprite
                library, or hover to
                get the whole menu. The same thing for the stage. At the top of the sprite pane are the properties of the
                sprite you're
                currently looking at such as its visibility status or its position on the screen.

            <h2>The basics</h2>
            <p>You will need the blocks I will show you now for basically the whole time you will be doing scratch.
    
    
            </p>
            <div class="move-block">
                <h3>Move-block</h3>
                <h4>Function</h4>
                <p>The move block moves an object(sprite) in the direction it is facing. So if a red square had a direction
                    of
                    90 degrees the move block would move it right. Note that all sprites start facing 90 degrees, not 0,
                    this can cause problems
                    if you forget about this as many people often do. The steps input is not how many jumps the sprite will
                    make
                    but how many pixels it will travel. Some people can get that wrong and are really frustrated. The
                    scratch team should
                    have called the move block move pixels instead of move steps.
                </p>
                <h4>location</h4>
                <p>The move block can be found at the very top of the motion category.</p>
                <img src="Images/move-block.png" alt="the move block">
    
            </div>
            <div class="turn">
                <h3>Turn-block</h3>
                <h4>Function</h4>
                <p>the turn block's function is pretty easy to understand, the block turns the corresponding sprite a
                    certain amount of degrees,
                    note that the amount can be negative.
                </p>
                <h4>Location</h4>
                <p>The turn block is located right under the move block in the motion category.</p>
                <img src="Images/turn-block.png" alt="the turn block">
            </div>
            <div class="forever">
                <h3>Forever</h3>
                <h4>Function</h4>
                <p>The forever block is a loop, it executes the commands inside it over and over again, but is not run
                    forever, it runs until the
                    project stops, and there are ways to stop forever loops but those are details and this course is an
                    intro
                    so you don't have to worry about that now.
                    Common ways of using forever loops are counters, physics, and motion.
                </p>
                <h4>Location</h4>
                <p>The forever loop is located in the middle of the controls category orange-brown blocks.</p>
                <img src="Images/forever-block.png" alt="the forever loop">
    
            </div>
            <div class="if">
                <h3>If conditional</h3>
                <h4>Function</h4>
                <p>If conditions are used to check if something is true or false. If the input is true then the command in
                    the if
                    is executed. Scratch has many conditions such as key()pressed?. There are also operator conditions such
                    as
                    ()=() these can be used to compare numbers or variables, we'll go over those in a later tutorial.
                    All conditions are are angular and therefore easy to recognize among the other types of blocks.
                </p>
                <h4>Location</h4>
                <p>The if and if else blocks are located right below the forever loop in the controls category.</p>
                <img src="Images/if-block.png" alt="the if block">
    
            </div>
            <div class="flag">
                <h3>When Flag Colicked</h3>
    
                <h4>Function</h4>
                <p>The when flag clicked block is probably the block that every scratch program contains, because this block
                    tells
                    the program what to do when the green flaf is clicked, the start button in other words. Once the flag is
                    clicked everything
                    under the when flag clicked block will run. This block is a so called hat block which means it
                    automatically runs all scripts
                    under it when the action(in this case the green flag is clicke) has occured.
                </p>
                <h4>Location</h4>
                <p>The when flag clicked block can be found as the first block in the events category(yellow blocks).</p>
                <img src="Images/flag-block.png" alt="the green flag block">
                <p>Note that I have scratch addons installed so the block you will see will not have cat ears.</p>
