        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
        <p>In the ever-changing landscape of the internet there is one thing that makes Chromium a unique browser
            engine; extensions. People use them constantly. The most handy extensions include ad-blockers, VPNs, AI
            detectors and extensions for customization.

        </p>
        <p>Once you master the very fine and delicate art of picking the extensions that are right for you. I hope this
            article helps you get hold of a couple of extensions you should definitely get your hands on. Have fun
            reading :) </p>
        <h2 id="adblock">Adblock Plus</h2>
        <p>This is an overall great Adblock extension that helps you navigate the web without needing to deal with
            annoying pop-ups on websites and just generally any annoying ads. It also allows non-intrusive ads that meet
            their strict criteria so that you still will see ads if you want to.</p>
        <p>Personally, I use the extension all the time, and where it really helps is YouTube because recently YouTube
            advertising has been getting out of control so I'm glad that there are ad-blockers capable of blocking
            YouTube ads, there are still some issues though, but the developers are constantly improving it.</p>
        <h2 id="seo">SEO analysis and Reviews by Woorank</h2>
        <p>This extension is an on-page SEO reviewing extension as it analyses every element on a webpage to create a
            map of what a website does well, does badly or doesn't do at all. You can then see all SEO ranking factors
            in the pop-up the extension gives you and comes in very handy when you have your own website and want to
            bump up your SEO ranking.</p>
        <p>Many advanced features are locked behind a premium paywall, but the information the extension gives for free
            should be enough for most people.</p>
        <h2 id="webchatGPT">WebChatGPT</h2>
        <p>Introducing a new paradigm in online communication, the "WebChatGPT" extension harnesses the power of
            OpenAI's language model to transform everyday chat experiences. It can use its web crawler to crawl the web
            and give users real-time results and not limit them to what was before September 2021. It is a very
            versatile tool and has quick handy shortcuts, for example writing articles, drafting emails and scripting
            videos.

        </p>
        <h2 id="ai-detector">Hive AI Detector</h2>
        <p>Hive AI detector is a great extension to see if something was generated by AI or not. It is very accurate and
            has never given me any false results. It is a simple icon on the bottom of the page where you put in the
            text you want to check and then get the results in a second or two.</p>
        <p>It is very reliable and can detect text generated by chatGPT even if you specifically ask it to be
            undetectable or use a prompt generator.

        </p>
        <h2 id="giphy">Giphy</h2>
        <p>Giphy is an extension that allows you to insert GIFs anywhere you write with a special pop-up. It brings the
            vast and entertaining world of GIFs right to your fingertips. It intuitive way to discover, select, and
            insert beautiful GIFs directly into your conversations, emails, or social media posts. With a user-friendly
            pop-up interface, users can effortlessly search through an extensive library of GIFs, ensuring that every
            message you want to deliver is not just delivered beautifully, but animated with the perfect visuals that it
            needs.</p>
        <p>The Giphy extension transcends the limitations of static text, enabling users to communicate with not only
            text but also humorous pictures and personality.</p>
        <h2 id="custom-cursor">Custom Cursor</h2>
        <p>The Custom Cursor extension is a great extension to create a sense of personality in your browser by getting
            rid of the standard cursor and replacing it with something much more fun and exciting from their library of
            many thousands of cursor packs that you can install with a single click.</p>
        <p>There are many packs to choose from and can fit any taste, do you want a Star-Wars-themed cursor, no problem.
            Do you want something more cyberpunk and flashy, you will find it too. Overall it is a great extension that
            will help you customize your cursor if you're not satisfied with the default one.

        </p>
        <h2 id="youtube-dislike">Return Youtube Dislike</h2>
        <p>The Return YouTube Dislike extension, as its name already says returns the dislike count on YouTube videos
            for full transparency since its removal in early November of 2021. This has two sides to it, on one hand, it
            is more transparent and more clear to people what they are watching, on the other, people can potentially be
            influenced by the decisions of the masses and not express their personal opinion.</p>
        <p>It is a handy extension to have and also the type of extension that you can install and then forget about
            since it rarely is updated as there is no need to do so.

        </p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As you've read in this article, you will now know how to streamline your workflow and have the maximum output
            in minimal time. I hope these extensions will help you become more productive and maximize your creative
            output.</p>
