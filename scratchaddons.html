    <h1>Scratch Addons</h1>
    <div class="date"><p>April 4th 2023</p></div>
    <h2>Why scratch Addons?</h2>
    <h3>1</h3>
    <p>Scratch addons can really help you as you progress in scratch. When you have a big project you would find it very
        frustrating to
        search for every custom block definition or broadcast reciever by hand, luckily smoeone made an addon for that.
        Scratch addons also comes in useful in troobleshooting, since there is a debugger addon and a clone count
        reporter.
        These two addons made troobleshooting in scratch so much easier for me when I istalled Scratch Addons.
        Also scratch addons can help you customize the look and feel of the website and editor, such as the dark theme
        addon or
        the view in turbowarp addon.

    </ul>
    <div id="clone-count">
        <h3>Clone Counter</h3>
        <p>
            the clone counter addon comes in useful when you have many clones and you want to see if all of them get
            deleted in the
            right place. For example you have a menu made of clones and if they don't get deleted when you start
            playing then you'll immediately see that in the clone counter.

        </p>

    </div>
    <div id="pause-button">
        <h3>Pause Button</h3>
        <p>The pause button addon enables to stop a project and then resume it, this is useful for example you're
            testing a
            specific thing in a specific region of your game you don't want to try to get there all over again
            each time you test your game which will take up valueable time, you want to pause the project,
            modify your code and test it again.
        </p>


    </div>
    <div id="profile-banner">
        <h3>Profile Page Banner</h3>
        <p>This addon isn't that important, but enhances your experience in scratch significantly, the default profile
            page isn't the best so this addon is worth a trym, it transforms the featured project into a banner and
            gives all the profile info underneath it.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div id="block-counter">
        <h3>Block Counter</h3>
        <p>The block counter addon is pretty simple it adds the number of blocks in your project at the top of the
            editor
            this can be used to compare the size of different projects.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div id="find-bar">
        <h3>Editor Find Bar</h3>
        <p>The Editor find bar is a really helpful addon because when you try to navigate across a big scratch project
            (I mean like really big
            1000+ blocks) it will be very hard to find specific scripts because there are just too many so your eye will
            search for that
            script for like a minute. This addon adds a find bar where you can easily find: custom blocks(functions),
            Event recievers(broadcast hat blocks)
            and variable uses in the sprite you are currently in.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Cat-Blocks">
        <h3>Cat Blocks</h3>
        <p> The cat blocks addon isn't actually essential, but it's funny to see all hat blocks now have cat ears and
            eyes.
            I think that it's a good addon and makes the boring hat blocks disappear, but you can stick to the
            hat blocks if you like. Cat blocks were invented for April fools day on scratch, since then there were
            some people who liked it so much they made an addon for it.


        </p>

    </div>
    <div id="Sprite-Folders">
        <h3>Sprite Folders</h3>
        <p>The Sprite folder addon is useful when you have a lot of sprites in a specific category, but you don't need
            them shown all at once.
            The sprite folder addon creates a folder which you can name and see inside of it when needed but all the
            sprites inside it
            size down to the size of a single sprite when the folder is closed. Everything which is described here
            is also applied to costumes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Cloud-Games">
        <h3>Cloud Games</h3>
        <p>
            The Cloud games addon displays cloud games and their users under the "games" widget in the browser extension
            icon.
            This addon helps a lot when picking a cloud game you want to play, so you automatically know how many people
            are playing which
            game. Games that are included into the widget are for example griffpatch's slither.io clones or the
            multiplayer cloud platformer.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Rename-Broadcasts">
        <h3>Rename Broadcasts</h3>
        <p>
            It is such a pain when you discover that a broadcast you named with a typo can't be renamed and changed,
            this is where
            the rename broadcasts addon comes in, it allows you to rename broadcast that you either misspelled or you
            want to reuse for something
            else than you initially planned to. This addon helped me out so much throughout my scratch experience
            because it gives broadcasts with
            a bad name a second chance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Custom-Zoom">
        <h3>Custom Code Area Zoom</h3>
        <p>
            The custom code area zoom addon allows you to set your own limit on how far you can zoom out in the scratch
            code editor.
            This addon is especially useful for big projects (1000+ blocks) this is where you can see all your code
            without having to scroll.
            Personally I use it because it is very useful when working with a lot of code and it allows you to get al
            overview of you project.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Costume-Snapping">
        <h3>Costume Editor Snapping</h3>
        <p>When designing sprites in scratch you use the costume editor. Sometimes you need something to be center
            aligned,
            but be above the center of the canvas. the Costume Editor Snapping addon snaps objects to the middle of the
            canvas
            far away from the center point. the addon also allows you to snapp objects to be on the same longtitude or
            latitude so
            that it is much easier to align objects. I would highly recommend this addon to anyone who uses the scratch
            costume editor
            to draw their sprites.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div id="Hide-Palette">
        <h3>Auto Hiding Block Palette</h3>
        <p>Do you know the palette with all the blocks is so annoying when you don't need it and takes up so much space
            on the screen. Yeah
            I know many scratcher would like it to just automatically disappear while you're coding and you don't need
            it. Well, if you think so too
            you're lucky, because this addon solves the problem for you, it hides the palette when you're not hovering
            above the block category menu
            so it saves a ton of space and leaves it available to coders which get all the space to code they need.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Hide-Variables">
        <h3>Hide new Variables</h3>
        <p>You know when you never want variables to show on the stage they do right, and that is so annoying. If you
            agree with
            me you will probably want to not show so that it's not as frustrating to delete them all off the stage. This
            addon
            is specifically made to hide the annoying variable reporters on the stage, and I hope after you've installed
            this, you
            won't be as frustrated as now.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div id="Hide-Stage">
        <h3>Hide Stage and Sprite Pane</h3>
        <p>Basically this addon expands the code area to the limits, it is now full screen and perfect for a time when
            testing isn't
            needed because then you can focus on the code more than the stage. So if you like to have a big code area,
            and you
            don't mind to wait for testing this is a perfect addon for you.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="block-switching">
        <h3>Block switching</h3>
        <p>Block switching is an addon you just have to install, it helps A LOT. What it does is it adds blocks of
            a similar category when you right click a specific block. For example if you right click a change y by block
            it will show you: change y by, set y to, change x by and set x to blocks. An example of this block's use is
            when you have a duplicated
            show-block, but you want it to be a hide-block you can just right click it and tada you set the block to a
            hide block and it appears
            instead of the show block</p>

    </div>

    <div id="debug">
        <h3>Debugger</h3>
        <p>The debugger addon is exceptionally useful, probably even more useful than the block switching addon. The
            debugger
            addon adds many new features such as a "log" block or a a thread manager and even a console where you can
            see all
            important events happen such as sprite cloning. This addon saves your life when sometimes you only then
            notice that
            clones are cloning clones which is really bad because there are only 300 clones allowed in scratch.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="shift">
        <h3>Do not Shift Pasted Items</h3>
        <p> this addon is exceptionally useful for drawing in the scratch image editor because it allows you to not have
            the usual
            effect which happens when you paste an item. This shifting of pasted items is really annoying so this addon
            was made and it
            removes this feature. This means you can now have all pasted items in one spot. </p>
